# Flood Yearly Statistics Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a web-based dashboard that provides insights into yearly flood statistics across various countries, based on data sourced from reputable flood databases. The visualization aims to help users understand flood occurrences, fatalities, persons affected, and economic losses by using interactive charts.

## Features
- **Interactive Chart Visualizations**: The application uses Chart.js to provide bar and pie charts for better understanding flood statistics.
- **Customizable Data Filters**: Users can select between datasets, specific countries, time ranges, and different aspects of the data (e.g., occurrences, fatalities, etc.) to analyze.
- **Detailed Table View**: Click on the bars in the chart to view detailed records for the selected time period.

## Datasets
The dashboard supports data from the following sources:

1. **HANZE Dataset**: Contains data on the total number of floods by type that have occurred in 42 European countries from 1870 to 2020. Also includes average annual flood deaths per million persons.
